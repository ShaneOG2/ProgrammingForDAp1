# Programming for Data Analysis - Project 1 #

## Overview ##
This repository contains my work for Project 1 of the the Programming for Data Analysis Module at ATU as part of the Higher Diploma in Computing (Data Analytics). This repository contains: 

- The Jupyter notebook `Simulation Notebook.ipynb` which contains the main body of work. 
- A folder named 'img' which contains images used in `Simulation Notebook.ipynb`. 
- This README file which contains the project statement and how to get `Simulation Notebook.ipynb` running.

**Project Statement** - Create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon. 
- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible
- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

**Intructions to Reader** - Download `Simulation Notebook.ipynb` to you own local machine. 

To do:
1. Go to my repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/ShaneOG2/ProgrammingForDAp1).
2. Click on the green `<> Code` button and `Download Zip`.
3. Save folder to your local machine. 
4. Navigate to where you saved this folder using your command line. 
5. Type `jupyter notebook` - this will open and run `Simulation Notebook.ipynb` in your browser.
